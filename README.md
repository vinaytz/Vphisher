## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm or yarn
*   Git
*   A Supabase account

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vinaytz/Vphisher.git
    cd Vphisher
    ```

2.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and in the `Instagram-reel-link` directory.
    
    For the root `.env` (main admin dashboard):
    ```
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
    ```
    
    For `Instagram-reel-link/.env`:
    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_SUPABASE_URL` and `YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` with your actual Supabase project credentials.

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    For the main project (admin dashboard):
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

    For the Instagram reel link sub-project:
    ```bash
    cd Instagram-reel-link
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    cd ..
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the main admin dashboard:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or yarn dev
    ```
    The admin dashboard will typically run on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

    **Example Deployed Dashboard:** [https://vphisher.vercel.app](https://vphisher.vercel.app)

2.  **Start the Instagram reel link phishing application:**
    ```bash
    cd Instagram-reel-link
    npm run dev
    # or yarn dev
    cd ..
    ```
    The phishing application will typically run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## How to Use

1.  **Access the Admin Dashboard:** Once the main application is running, navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or your configured port) or `https://vphisher.vercel.app` in your web browser. 
2.  **Create a Campaign:** Use the dashboard to create a new phishing campaign. You'll be able to specify details for your simulated attack.
3.  **Generate a Fake Link:** The dashboard will generate a unique Instagram reel, post link(that you will enter while creating the link). This is the link you would share in a simulated social engineering scenario.
4.  **Monitor Activity:** The dashboard automatically updates when a victim submits their credentials. youâ€™ll be able to view login data as soon as it's captured.
5.  **Get Victim Credentials:** Review the collected data (username & password) to understand user behavior and identify vulnerabilities or...!!! .

## Usage

*   **Admin Dashboard:** Access the dashboard to create new phishing campaigns, generate unique reel, post links, and monitor collected data (username & password).
*   **Phishing Application:** Share the generated Instagram links. When a victim clicks the link, they will be redirected to a simulated Instagram login page.
